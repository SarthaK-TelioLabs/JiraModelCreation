## Jira Query Predictor with DVector Database

### Overview
This project leverages machine learning to predict Jira queries by utilizing solutions stored in a DVector database. The model is designed to enhance issue tracking and management by providing intelligent query suggestions based on historical data.

### Features
- **Predictive Modeling**: Uses advanced algorithms to predict Jira queries.
- **DVector Database Integration**: Efficiently retrieves and utilizes solution data stored in DVector for accurate predictions.
- **Automated Query Suggestions**: Enhances productivity by automating the query suggestion process.
- **Scalable and Adaptable**: Easily integrates with existing Jira setups and can be scaled to handle large datasets.

### Tech Stack
- **BERT Embeddings**: For transforming text data into meaningful vector representations.
- **DVector Database**: To store and manage solution vectors.
- **Python**: Main programming language for model development and integration.
- **TensorFlow/PyTorch**: For building and training the machine learning models.
- **scikit-learn**: For additional machine learning utilities and model evaluation.
- **Flask/FastAPI**: For creating a web API to serve the model predictions.

### Getting Started
